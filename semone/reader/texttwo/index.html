  The menu handed to customers at Chi-Chi's restaurants these days is a far cry from its
  predecessor. The old, standard rectangular menu was replaced this spring with one that
  features a jagged edge, warm earth tones and lively drawings of fresh fruits and
  vegetables. The bill of fare was designed to better showcase 25 new items.<br><br>
  <b><span class="rollover storyrollover">
  "The new menu has a fun-looking, new-wave shape," says Robert Carl, a spokesman for
  the Louisville, Kentucky, company, which has 148 units nationwide and is a subsidiary of
  Irvine, California-based Prandium. The new menu is part of the repositioning message
  Chi-Chi's is trying to send consumers. "You can tell this is not the same old food," he
  says. "It's a hip, awesome-looking menu."<br><br></b></span>
  Like Chi-Chi's, many restaurants realize that their menu's appearance sends out subtle
  signals that can affect how customers perceive their operation. "The menu is part of your
  brand identity," says Bill Main, founder of Bill Main and Associates, a Chico, California,
  foodservice management and training company. "It's a reflection of who you are in the
  marketplace. If you have a dirty menu, it sends out a message that you probably have a
  dirty kitchen. If it's a bright, clean, sharp menu, it looks like you're a bright, clean
  operation." A bill of fare can also subtly direct customers to order higher-profit items.
  A menu redesign can improve sales an average of 2 to 10 percent, according to restaurant
  consultants interviewed by Restaurants USA. For an operation that brings in $1 million a
  year, that amounts to an additional $20,000 to $100,000 annually. "Restaurateurs should
  view menus as an investment not as a cost," says Main. "The driving force behind profits
  is the menu."<br><br><b><span class="rollover formrollover">
  Is your menu as effective as it could be? Chances are there is room for improvement.
  "One of the things I've found is that 90 to 95 percent of menus can be improved," says
  Bill Paul, founder of Cincinnati-based The Menu Advantage, a company that helps
  restaurants develop their menus.<br><br></b>
<b>  Subliminal messages</b><br></span>
  If you think customers decide on their own what to order, think again. "A menu should
  tell a customer what you want them to buy," says Steve Miller, who teaches a menudesign
  seminar and is president of the Miller Resource Group, in Grafton, Massachusetts.
  The placement of menu items, the graphics and the item descriptions all send messages
  about what you want customers to order. For example, in a four-page menu — including
  front and back covers — Miller says the "power position" is on the inside right page
  above the center. Menu designer William Doerfler identified this as an optimum position
  in the November 1978 issue of The Cornell Hotel and Restaurant Administration
  Quarterly.<br><br>
  "The placement is very important," agrees restaurant consultant Isidore Kharasch,
  president of Chicago-based Hospitality Works, citing the example of a microbrewery that
  came to him for help with its menu. "They were selling mostly hamburgers and
  sandwiches, and the chef wanted to sell more of the higher-end items," Kharasch
  recounts. He recommended that the restaurant place the high-end specialties on the inside
  right page, toward the middle, and move the burgers and sandwiches from that spot to the
  back page. "We increased the font in that area [with the specialties]. Then on the back,
  we reduced the font for the burgers and sandwiches. It was a very subtle thing. In the first
  week [after the change], the average check went from $16 to $21. It's not that people
  were looking to order sandwiches and burgers, but people were being forced to order
  them."<br><br><b><span class="rollover historyrollover">
  A menu item's position within a list can also affect sales. People tend to remember the top
  two items on a list and the bottom item, says Miller. "Nothing goes in those spots by
  accident," he says.<br><br>
  Because all locations are not equal on a menu, restaurateurs need to prioritize what they
  want to sell, says Paul. "That's sometimes difficult for restaurateurs to do. You rarely hear
  them prioritize what they want to sell. Instead, they say everything on the menu is good."
  What items should restaurateurs put in the high-profile spots? "Items that have a high
  margin and appeal are strategically placed to produce the highest margins," says Lowell
  Petrie, senior director of brand marketing for Denny's, headquartered in Spartanburg,
  South Carolina.<br><br></b></span>
  Of course, logic also plays a role in arranging a bill of fare. For example, appetizers tend
  to go in the top of the left panel — a high-profile position that also makes sense
  sequentially. "It's a combination of logic tempered with strategy and doability," says
  Paul.<br><br>
  "The same item on a menu will sell differently if placed differently," says Andy Lansing,
  president and chief operating officer of Levy Restaurants, a Chicago-based restaurant
  group with 17 restaurants, ranging from the casual-dining Mrs. Levy's Delicatessen to
  Spiaggia, a fine-dining Italian restaurant. He notes that the same basic placement
  principles apply — no matter the type of restaurant concept — but he adds a couple of
  caveats. "Nothing is going to sell if it's not good," he stresses. And servers play an
  important role in determining what customers will order. "The menu helps steer people in
  the right direction," says Lansing, "but the servers are the ones who close the deal." <br><br>

      Back when Paul Rand wrote “There is no such thing as bad content, only bad form,” I remember being intensely annoyed. I took it as an abdication of a designer’s responsibility to meaning. Over time, I have come to read it differently: he was not defending hate speech or schlock or banality; he meant that the designer’s purview is to shape, not to write. But that shaping itself is a profoundly affecting form. (Perhaps this is the reason that modern designers—Rand, Munari, Leoni—always seem to end their careers designing children’s books. The children’s book is the purest venue of the designer/author because the content is negligible and the evocative potential of the form unlimited.)

“They work ‘sometimes,’ but ‘sometimes’ isn’t enough for most people,” explained Mr. Maeda. “But I’m the guy who thought in the early 1990s that making home pages on something called the World Wide Web was a silly idea, which would never catch on.”<br><br><br><br>

      But if the innovator has a clear conscience that the product materially improves people’s lives — first among them, the creator’s — then the only path is to push forward. Users bear ultimate responsibility for their actions and makers should not be blamed for the misuse or overuse of their products.<br><br><br><br>
