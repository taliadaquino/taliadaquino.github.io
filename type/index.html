	<t> Type surrounds us. </i></t> <i><br><br>When we wake up, when we complete tasks and most importantly when and how we communicate. Almost every activity done as humans uses typography in some form. But how much do we notice of this design practice? It is regularly used and commonly ignored; but when typography is appreciated and noticed thereâ€™s a key denominator the attempt to <br></i><t> outdo what has been done <br>before,<br> </t> <i> resulting in an over done practice we are still yet to perfect. When designing a typeface you ask yourself a group of key questions to ensure the best quality for your desired outcome.<p>
		<ul>
			<li> Is it a display or a text font? </li>
<li>What needs to stand out? </li>
<li> How will I make this different? </li>
</ul>
<p>

Realistically we need to remember:
<ul> <li> why is this important? </li>
	<li> Is it different from before? </li>
	<li> Is it being designed just to be different?</li> </ul>
	<p> The more we design and use our typography the quicker we forget the key necessities for good type design.

<p>
Our world continues to change and adapt; a continuous and unavoidable consistent. Yet we can always rely on the fact that everyone now sits behind a computer to process communication and to follow what we give them as a <br><center>&nbsp;</i><t> default. </center></t> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>When they push away from the provided</i> <br><j> default </right></j>
<br><br><br><i>
they forget its purpose. Unless crafted the resolution perfectly, they forget how to fit typography into the design and continuously keep these components separate. Forgetting the over reliance and redundant use on typography in their work.
<p></i> <t>
Eliminate this problem all together and retract the dependence on typography to fix the poor design. Remember the purpose it was crafted for and when the designer asked themselves the key questions and use it in that form. </t>
<p><i>
When we keep creating we also eliminate. To what extent can we keep changing typefaces until there are too many options, so many opportunities they become obsolete to each other. The reliance we have of typefaces and the pressure we put on them to say so much is penetrating. Think of how a picture writes a thousand words, typography is twenty-six pictures to write from. Choosing a typeface can say more then necessary.


<p></i>
<t>
Go back to the basics and the beginning, don't think what can be done different but remember what has been done and why it worked.</i><i>
<ul>
Typefaces tell their own story and give their own rules: </li> </t>
<li>	Does it need to be read?</li>
<li>Does it need to stand out?</li>
<li>Does it need to add emphasis?</li>
</ul> <p> Families in typefaces are critical to saying more

<p></i>
<t>
Express your text, be bold in your words, be italic in your elegance. If we continue path his path we must change the rules of typography, change the reading of typography, change the creation of typography and most importantly change the use of typography. Enjoy the craftsmanship of fonts but don't abuse the beauty of typography. Modify the way we look at type, express type and appreciate type. If we change the future of font design we need to ensure there is no more abuse played on the reliance of typography.
