	THE CULT OF DONE MANIFESTO<br>
		<h6>Bre Pettis and Kio Stark

	There are three states of being.
	Not knowing, action and completion.<p>

	Accept that everything is a draft.
	It helps to get done.<p>

	There is no editing stage.<p>

	Pretending you know what you’re doing
	is almost the same as knowing what you
	are doing,<br> so just accept that you know
	what you’re doing even if you don’t
	and do it.<p>

	Banish procrastination. If you wait more
	than a week to get an idea done, abandon it.<p>

		The point of being done is not to finish but
	to get other things done.<p>


		Once you’re done you can throw it away.<p>


			Laugh at perfection. It’s boring and keeps
	you from being done.<p>


		People without dirty hands are wrong.
	Doing something makes you right.<p>

	Failure counts as done. So do mistakes.<p>

		 Destruction is a variant of done.<p>

			  If you have an idea and publish it on the
	internet, that counts as a ghost of done.<p>

		 Done is the engine of more.
