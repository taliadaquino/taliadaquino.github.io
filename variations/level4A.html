THE CULT OF DONE MANIFESTO<br>
	<h6>Bre Pettis and Kio Stark

There are three states of being.
Not knowing, action and completion.<p>

Accept that everything is a draft.
It helps to get done.<p>

There is no editing stage.<p>

Pretending you know what you’re doing
is almost the same as knowing what you
are doing,<br> so just accept that you know
what you’re doing even if you don’t
and do it.<p>

Banish procrastination. If you wait more
than a week to get an idea done, abandon it.<p>

	The point of being done is not to finish but
to get other things done.<p>


	Once you’re done you can throw it away.<p>


		Laugh at perfection. It’s boring and keeps
you from being done.<p>


	People without dirty hands are wrong.
Doing something makes you right.<p>

Failure counts as done. So do mistakes.<p>

	 Destruction is a variant of done.<p>

		  If you have an idea and publish it on the
internet, that counts as a ghost of done.<p>

	 Done is the engine of more.
