  In <b>Designer as Author</b> I argued that we are insecure about the value of our work. We are
  envious of the power, social position and cachet that artists and authors seem to
  command. By declaring ourselves "designer/authors" we hope to garner similar respect.
  Our deep-seated anxiety has motivated a movement in design that values origination of
  content over manipulation of content.<p>

  Designer as Author was an attempt to recuperate the act of design itself as essentially
  linguistic-a vibrant, evocative language. However, it has often been read as a call for
  designers to generate content: in effect, to become designers and authors, not
  designers as authors. While I am all for more authors, that was not quite the point I
  wanted to make.<br><b><p>

<span class="rollover support"> </span>
  The problem is one of content. The misconception is that without deep content, design
  is reduced to pure style, a bag of dubious tricks. In graphic-design circles, form-followsfunction
  is reconfigured as form-follows-content. If content is the source of form, always
  preceding it and imbuing it with meaning, form without content (as if that were even
  possible) is some kind of empty shell.<br></b><p>


  Back when Paul Rand wrote "There is no such thing as bad content, only bad form," I
  remember being intensely annoyed. I took it as an abdication of a designer's
  responsibility to meaning. Over time, I have come to read it differently: he was not
  defending hate speech or schlock or banality; he meant that the designer's purview is to
  shape, not to write. But that shaping itself is a profoundly affecting form. (Perhaps this is
  the reason that modern designers-Rand, Munari, Leoni-always seem to end their
  careers designing children's books. The children's book is the purest venue of the
  designer/author because the content is negligible and the evocative potential of the form
  unlimited.)?<br>
  <p>


  <span class="rollover two">
  <b>Designers also trade in storytelling. The elements we must master are not the content
  narratives but the devices of the telling: typography, line, form, color, contrast, scale,
  weight. We speak through our assignment, literally between the lines.<br></b><p>

  </span>

  <span class="rollover three">
  The span of graphic design is not a history of concepts but of forms. <b>Form has evolved
  dramatically from one year to the next, and suggests a profession that continually
  revises and reshapes the world through the way it is rendered. Stellar examples of
  graphic design, design that changes the way we look at the world, are often found in
  service of the most mundane content: an ad for ink, cigarettes, sparkplugs or
  machinery. Think of Piet Zwart's catalogues for electrical cable; or the travel posters of
  Cassandre or Matter; or the New Wave work of Weingart, Greiman and Freidman; or
  the punk incitations of Jamie Reid, in which the manipulation of form has an essential,
  even transformative, meaning.<br></b><p>
  </span>


  Because the nature of the designed object is limited, individual objects are rarely
  substantial enough to contain fully rendered ideas. Ideas develop over many projects,
  spanning years. Form itself is indexical. We are intimately, physically connected to the
  work we produce, and it is inevitable that our work bears our stamp. The choice of
  projects in each designer's oeuvre lays out a map of interests and proclivities. (I use the
  singular designer in the categorical sense, not the individual.) <b>The way those projects
  are parsed out, disassembled, reorganized and rendered reveals a philosophy, an
  aesthetic position, an argument and a critique.<br></b><p>

  This deep connection to making also positions design in a modulating role between the
  user and the world. By manipulating form, design reshapes that essential relationship.
  Form is replaced by exchange. The things we make negotiate a relationship over which
  we have a profound control.<br>
  <p>

  The trick is to find ways to speak through treatment, via a range of rhetorical devices-?
  from the written to the visual to the operational-to make those proclamations as
  poignant as possible, and to return consistently to central ideas, to re-examine and reexpress.
  In this way we build a body of work, and from that body of work emerges a
  singular message, maybe even what it feels like to be living now. As a popular film critic
  once wrote, "A movie is not what it is about, it's how it is about it." Likewise, for us,
  ourWhat is a How. Our content is, perpetually, Design itself.<br>

    Not only is “form follows ...” often quoted incorrectly, it is not even accurate: the original wording was “form ever follows function.” It is also routinely misattributed, mostly to 20th-century modernist grandees, like Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe, but was actually coined by the less famous American architect, Louis Sullivan.
    <p>
    Misused though Sullivan’s quote has been, his point, that the style of architecture should reflect its purpose, made sense at the time, and continued to do so for much of the last century, not just for buildings, but objects too. That was then. Thanks to digital technology, designers can squeeze so many functions into such tiny containers that there is more computing power in a basic cellphone (not a fancy model, like a BlackBerry or iPhone, just a cheap one) than at NASA’s headquarters when it began in 1958. That is why the appearance of most digital products bears no relation to what they do.
